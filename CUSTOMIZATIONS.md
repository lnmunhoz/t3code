# Customizations

A running history of every change made to this custom version of T3 Code, newest first. See the "This is a custom fork" section in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for how to add entries.

Each entry: date, title, what changed, and why.

## 2026-11-09 — Auto-push to fork after each commit

**What:** Added `.vite-hooks/post-commit`, which pushes `local/custom` to the `fork` remote in the background after every commit on that branch.

**Why:** Keep the public fork in sync automatically instead of relying on remembering to push.

## 2026-11-09 — Customization log and fork tracking

**What:** Added the "This is a custom fork" section to `AGENTS.md` and created this file. Created the public fork https://github.com/lnmunhoz/t3code, added it as the `fork` remote, and `local/custom` is pushed there after each commit.

**Why:** Keep a durable record of every customization and the motivation behind it, so we can always look back later (and know what to carry forward when syncing with upstream). The fork backs up the custom work and is open source.

## 2026-11-09 — Local voice model dependency (kokoro-js), uncommitted

**What:** Added `kokoro-js` to `apps/web/package.json` and disabled build scripts for `onnxruntime-node` and `protobufjs` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (the web app only uses the onnxruntime-web backend).

**Why:** Work in progress toward higher-quality spoken notifications with a local TTS model instead of only the system Web Speech voices.

## 2026-11-09 — Desktop dev no longer auto-opens DevTools, uncommitted

**What:** Removed the `openDevTools({ mode: "detach" })` call for development builds in `apps/desktop/src/window/DesktopWindow.ts`.

**Why:** A detached DevTools window popping up on every desktop dev launch was distracting.

## 2026-11-09 — Spoken thread notifications (`2ece8b98c2`)

**What:** Thread alerts can say the thread title aloud ("<title> complete", "<title> needs approval", "<title> failed") via the Web Speech API, after the chime or instead of it. Follows the existing sound modes, queues instead of overlapping, and supports any installed voice. Key files: `apps/web/src/notificationSpeech.ts`, `apps/web/src/threadNotifications.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/settings/NotificationSettings.tsx`, `packages/contracts/src/settings.ts`.

**Why:** Know which thread finished or needs attention without looking at the screen.

## 2026-11-09 — Thread sidebar can resize almost full-width (`f2362e1380`)

**What:** Lowered `THREAD_MAIN_CONTENT_MIN_WIDTH` from 640px to 192px in `apps/web/src/components/threadSidebarWidth.ts`.

**Why:** Allow dragging the sidebar much wider while keeping a sliver of the chat visible.
